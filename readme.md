## ❓ FAQ

Q: Isn't NextJS completely overkill for this project? Won't it add more overhead than necessary?

A: Yes. NextJS is used because that's what I'm familiar with and I wanted to get this done quickly. I need to be able to extend this application with reactivity in case it's required later and I need the SEO that NextJS allows. Ergo NextJS was used.
